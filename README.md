# mio
An easy to use header-only cross-platform C++11 memory mapping library with an MIT license.

mio has been created with the goal to be easily includable (i.e. no dependencies) in any C++ project that needs memory mapped file IO without the need to pull in Boost.

Please feel free to open an issue, I'll try to address any concerns as best I can.

### Why?
Because memory mapping is the best thing since sliced bread!

More seriously, the primary motivation for writing this library instead of using Boost.Iostreams, was the lack of support for establishing a memory mapping with an already open file handle/descriptor. This is possible with mio.

Furthermore, Boost.Iostreams' solution requires that the user pick offsets exactly at page boundaries, which is cumbersome and error prone. mio, on the other hand, manages this internally, accepting any offset and finding the nearest page boundary.

Albeit a minor nitpick, Boost.Iostreams implements memory mapped file IO with a `std::shared_ptr` to provide shared semantics, even if not needed, and the overhead of the heap allocation may be unnecessary and/or unwanted.
In mio, there are two classes to cover the two use-cases: one that is move-only (basically a zero-cost abstraction over the system specific mmapping functions), and the other that acts just like its Boost.Iostreams counterpart, with shared semantics.

### How to create a mapping
There are three ways to do that:

- Using the constructor, which throws on failure:
```c++
mio::mmap_source mmap(path, offset, size_to_map);
```

- Using the factory function:
```c++
std::error_code error;
mio::mmap_source mmap = mio::make_mmap_source(path, offset, size_to_map, error);
```

- Using the `map` member function:
```c++
std::error_code error;
mio::mmap_source mmap;
mmap.map(path, offset, size_to_map, error);
```

Moreover, in each case, you can provide either some string type for the file's path, or you can use an existing, valid file handle.
```c++
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <mio/mmap.hpp>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    // NOTE: error handling omitted for brevity.
    const int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    mio::mmap_source mmap(fd, 0, mio::map_entire_file);
    // ...
}
```
However, mio does not check whether the provided file descriptor has the same access permissions as the desired mapping, so the mapping may fail. Such errors are reported via the `std::error_code` out parameter that is passed to the mapping function.

### Example
```c++
#include <mio/mmap.hpp>
#include <system_error> // for std::error_code
#include <cstdio> // for std::printf
#include <cassert>
#include <algorithm>

int handle_error(const std::error_code& error)
{
    const auto& errmsg = error.message();
    std::printf("error mapping file: %s, exiting...\n", errmsg.c_str());
    return error.value();
}

int main()
{
    // Read-write memory map the whole file by using `map_entire_file` where the
    // length of the mapping is otherwise expected, with the factory method.
    std::error_code error;
    mio::mmap_sink rw_mmap = mio::make_mmap_sink(
        "file.txt", 0, mio::map_entire_file, error);
    if (error) { return handle_error(error); }

    // You can use any iterator based function.
    std::fill(rw_mmap.begin(), rw_mmap.end(), 0);

    // Or manually iterate through the mapped region just as if it were any other 
    // container, and change each byte's value (since this is a read-write mapping).
    for (auto& b : rw_mmap) {
        b += 10;
    }

    // Or just change one value with the subscript operator.
    const int answer_index = rw_mmap.size() / 2;
    rw_mmap[answer_index] = 42;

    // Don't forget to flush changes to disk, which is NOT done by the destructor for
    // more explicit control of this potentially expensive operation.
    rw_mmap.sync(error);
    if (error) { return handle_error(error); }

    // We can then remove the mapping, after which rw_mmap will be in a default
    // constructed state, i.e. this has the same effect as if the destructor had been
    // invoked.
    rw_mmap.unmap();

    // Now create the same mapping, but in read-only mode.
    mio::mmap_source ro_mmap = mio::make_mmap_source(
        "file.txt", 0, mio::map_entire_file, error);
    if (error) { return handle_error(error); }

    const int the_answer_to_everything = ro_mmap[answer_index];
    assert(the_answer_to_everything == 42);
}
```

`mio::basic_mmap` is move-only, but if multiple copies to the same mapping are needed, use `mio::basic_shared_mmap` which has `std::shared_ptr` semantics and has the same interface as `mio::basic_mmap`.
```c++
#include <mio/shared_mmap.hpp>

mio::shared_mmap_source shared_mmap1("path", offset, size_to_map);
mio::shared_mmap_source shared_mmap2(std::move(mmap1)); // or use operator=
mio::shared_mmap_source shared_mmap3(std::make_shared<mio::mmap_source>(mmap1)); // or use operator=
mio::shared_mmap_source shared_mmap4;
shared_mmap4.map("path", offset, size_to_map, error);
```

It's possible to define the type of a byte (which has to be the same width as `char`), though aliases for the most common ones are provided by default:
```c++
using mmap_source = basic_mmap_source<char>;
using ummap_source = basic_mmap_source<unsigned char>;

using mmap_sink = basic_mmap_sink<char>;
using ummap_sink = basic_mmap_sink<unsigned char>;
```
But it may be useful to define your own types, say when using the new `std::byte` type in C++17:
```c++
using mmap_source = mio::basic_mmap_source<std::byte>;
using mmap_sink = mio::basic_mmap_sink<std::byte>;
```

Though generally not needed, since mio maps users requested offsets to page boundaries, you can query the underlying system's page allocation granularity by invoking `mio::page_size()`, which is located in `mio/page.hpp`.

### Installation
mio is a header-only library, so just copy the contents in `mio/include` into your system wide include path, such as `/usr/include`, or into your project's lib folder.
