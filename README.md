# mulle-mmap

An easy to use cross-platform C memory mapping library with a MIT license.

This is based on [https://github.com/mandreyel/mio](), which is a C++ header
only library. This library uses traditional .h/.c separation though.
It has no shared pointer functionality.

Use Objective-C if you need retain counts.
